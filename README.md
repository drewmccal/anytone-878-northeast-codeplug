# Anytone D878UV codeplug for the Northeast United States

KB1PJD 2018.12.03

This repo will contain a codeplug and files that are useful for Hams traveling along the 
Northeast Corridor of the United States. This codeplug should be useful for both the AT-D868UV and the AT-D878UV.

The current codeplug primarily contains channels from NJTRBO (New Jersey DMR) and NEDECN (New England DMR).
I will eventually add more entries for NYMETRO and Upstate NY, and potentially points south of New Jersey.  I will also eventually
add more Brandmeister repeaters channels in the Dartmouth-Lake Sunapee Region to this codeplug
(Green Mountain Amateur Radio Society WX1NH).  CTARES (Connecticut DMR) would also be a nice-to-have, unfortunately this group doesn't
publish Anytone formatted codeplugs nor a CSV file, what a shame, since it is a dense repeater network.  Same goes to NYMETRO/BRONXTRBO.

I frequently travel between Princeton, NJ, and Nashua, NH.

Again, this is a work in progress, so I will update as time goes on, and hopefully someone else finds it useful.  It took lots of work to combine
the talkgroup names between NJTRBO and NECDECN since there was quite a bit of overlap.  Let me know if you improve these files.  I'd greatly
appreciate it.
